# Checklist for Installing AI Applications (Python-based, Open Source)

## 1. Verify Hardware Requirements
### Does the AI app require specialized hardware?
✅ **Yes** → Check the following:
- **GPU Requirements**  
  - Does the app require a specific type of GPU (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD)?  
  - Check if the GPU must meet certain specifications (e.g., CUDA support, VRAM size).
- **Dedicated Servers or Cloud Infrastructure**  
  - Does the app require access to dedicated hardware or cloud resources (e.g., AWS, Azure)?
- **System Specifications**  
  - Does your system meet the required RAM, CPU, storage, and network bandwidth for smooth operation?

### Can your current hardware support the app?
✅ **Yes** → Proceed to the next step.  
❌ **No** → Consider alternatives:
- 🔍 **Procurement:** Can you request additional hardware (e.g., high-performance laptops with GPUs)?  
- 🔍 **Department Resources:** Are there server computers (with required hardware) within your department that you could access?  
- 🔍 **Cloud Access:** Can you leverage cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Cloud) for GPU-heavy workloads?

## 2. Check for Software Requirements
### Does the AI app require additional software to run?
✅ **Yes** → List the necessary software (e.g., libraries, frameworks, APIs).  
❌ **No** → Proceed to department approval verification.

## 3. Verify Department Approval
### Is the software approved by your department?
✅ **Yes** → Verify that the approved version is compatible with the AI app.  
❌ **No** → Can you request approval for the software?  
- 🔍 **Who is responsible for approvals?** (e.g., IT Security, Procurement, Legal)  
- 🔍 **Approval Process & Timeline:** What’s the process, and how long does it typically take?  

### Costs and Requirements for Software Approval:
- 🔍 **Licensing:** What are the licensing requirements and costs for the software?  
- 🔍 **Cloud Access or External Dependencies:** Does the software need cloud resources or APIs? Ensure this is compatible with your environment.

## 4. IT Support for Setup and Configuration
### Can your team install and use the software and hardware independently?
✅ **Yes** → Can your team set up the software and hardware without IT support?  
❌ **No** → Consider:  
- 🔍 **IT Staff Requirements:** Will you need specific IT staff (e.g., CS, IT support) for setup and maintenance?  
- 🔍 **Installation Restrictions:** Is there a policy restricting local installations, or is installation allowed in virtualized environments?  

---

## 5. Check Access and Network Requirements
### Are there any access or network-related barriers to running the AI app?
- 🔍 **Network Configuration:** Does the software require firewall changes, VPN access, or special network configurations?  
- 🔍 **External Dependencies:** Does the AI app need access to external data sources, cloud services, or APIs (e.g., GPU-based APIs)?  
- 🔍 **Special Permissions:** Are there any specific permissions needed for accessing GPUs, external APIs, or cloud infrastructure?  

---

## 6. Confirm Security and Compliance
### Does the software meet IT Privacy Impact Assessments/security standards?
- 🔍 **Security Assessment:** Has the software undergone a security review or Privacy Impact Assessment (especially if working with Protected B data)? Are there any concerns regarding data privacy, protection, encryption, or vulnerabilities?  

### Hardware Maintenance:
- 🔍 **Support for Hardware:** Does your department offer support for specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs)?  
- 🔍 **Software Updates:** What is the process for maintaining the software, especially if it’s running on specialized hardware?
